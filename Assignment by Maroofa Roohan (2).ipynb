    "#1. **Multithreading vs. Multiprocessing**:\n",
    " #  - **Multithreading** is preferable when tasks are I/O-bound (e.g., reading/writing files or network requests), as threads can handle multiple I/O operations without blocking each other. Threads share the same memory space, making communication between them faster.\n",
    "  # - **Multiprocessing** is a better choice for CPU-bound tasks (e.g., number crunching, heavy computations) since each process has its own memory space and can run independently on multiple CPU cores, providing true parallelism.\n",
    "#_________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________\n",
    "#2. **Process Pool**:\n",
    " #  - A **process pool** is a collection of worker processes used to execute tasks concurrently. It efficiently manages multiple processes by maintaining a pool of pre-spawned processes and reusing them for tasks. This reduces the overhead of creating and destroying processes\n",
    " # frequently and improves performance in scenarios with many short-lived tasks\n",

    "#3. **Multiprocessing in Python**:\n",
    " #  - **Multiprocessing** allows Python programs to execute in parallel across multiple CPU cores, overcoming the limitations imposed by the Global Interpreter Lock (GIL) in multithreaded programs. It is useful for CPU-bound tasks and\n",
    " # is implemented using the `multiprocessing` module in Python, enabling the use of multiple processes to run different parts of a program simultaneously.\n",
